# Introduction
Gameboy is (surprisingly) a Gameboy Emulator. It's currently a Work In Progress, but can play a few games

# Usage
## Compilation
To compile the program, go to the directory of the project, and run :

	cmake .
	make

## Using it after compilation
To use the program, run the executable with the ROM file as an argument

# TODO
## Games I test this emulator on
 
 * Tetris (completely playable, at least to my knowledge)
 * Link's Awakening (seems to be playable until you go left of the first map, then south, and then it's really strange)
 * Pok√©mon Red (playable)
 
## Things to do before the emulator is actually pleasant to play with

 * Savegame implementation
 
## Things to do after all of this

 * Begin GBC support
 * Sound support
