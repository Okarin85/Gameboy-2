# Introduction
Gameboy is (surprisingly) a Gameboy Emulator. It can be used to play a few games, including Pokemon Red.

# Usage
## Compilation
To compile the program, go to the directory of the project, and run :

	cmake .
	make

## Using it after compilation
To use the program, run the executable with the ROM file as an argument. The keys to play are (on a BÉPO keyboard) :

 * B for the A button
 * É for the B button
 * Return for the Start button
 * Space for the Select button
 * Directional keys for … the directional keys
 * You can push F1 to toggle Fast mode
 
On a QWERTY keyboard, the keys are the same, but should be Q for the A button, and W for the B button.

## Games I tested this emulator on
 
 * Tetris (playable)
 * Link's Awakening (playable)
 * Pokémon Red (playable)
